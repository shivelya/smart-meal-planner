**As a** user,  
**I want** to select or add ingredients when creating a pantry item,  
**so that** I can easily track the foods I have without worrying about duplicates or database structure.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. When creating a new pantry item, the user can start typing the name of an ingredient.
2. The system should search the database for matching ingredients and suggest them in real-time (autocomplete).
3. If the ingredient exists:
   - Selecting it will populate the pantry item with the corresponding `IngredientId`.
4. If the ingredient does not exist:
   - The user can enter the new ingredient name.
   - The system will create the new ingredient in the database before creating the pantry item.
5. From the user‚Äôs perspective, they do not need to distinguish between ingredients and pantry items; they only interact with ingredient names.
6. On the backend, all ingredients are stored in a single table for searchability and consistency.

### Notes

- Ingredient fields: `Id`, `Name`, `Category`
- PantryItem fields: `Id`, `IngredientId`, `Quantity`, `Unit`
- The backend should expose a search endpoint: `GET /ingredients?search=<text>`
- Pantry item creation should accept either an `IngredientId` or an `IngredientName`

### User Story 1: Pantry Item from Packaged Food (e.g., Box of Crackers)

**As a** user  
**I want** to take a picture of a packaged food item, such as a box of crackers  
**So that** the system can read the packaging, identify it as "crackers," and automatically create a pantry item entry for me  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I take a photo of a packaged food item  
- When the system processes the image  
- Then it recognizes the product type (e.g., crackers)  
- And it generates a pantry item with the appropriate name and details  

**Extended Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system should attempt to extract additional details from the packaging (e.g., brand, weight, flavor).  
- If the system is highly confident (above a set threshold), it auto-populates the pantry item.  
- If confidence is low, the system should prompt the user to confirm or correct the item.  
- The pantry item should include default quantity (e.g., 1 box) unless more detail is detected.  
- The user should be able to edit the generated pantry item before saving.

### User Story 2: Pantry Item from Fresh Food (e.g., Banana)

**As a** user

**So that** the system can recognize it as "banana" and automatically create a pantry item entry for me  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I take a photo of a fresh food item  
- When the system processes the image  
- Then it recognizes the food type (e.g., banana)  
- And it generates a pantry item with the appropriate name and details

- The system should distinguish between different fresh foods (e.g., banana vs. plantain).  
- If the system is highly confident (above a set threshold), it auto-populates the pantry item.  
- If confidence is low, the system should prompt the user to confirm or correct the item.  
- The pantry item should default to a unit type appropriate for fresh produce (e.g., ‚Äú1 banana‚Äù or ‚Äú1 bunch‚Äù).  
- The user should be able to edit the generated pantry item before saving.  

---

### User Story: Search Pantry Items by Name

**As a** user  
**I want** to search for pantry items by entering their name  
**So that** I can quickly find a specific item in my pantry list without scrolling  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on the pantry screen  
- When I type a name (full or partial) into the search bar  
- Then the pantry list updates to show only matching items  
- And the search is case-insensitive (e.g., "Crackers" matches "crackers")  

**Extended Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system should support partial matches (e.g., typing "crack" returns "crackers").  
- The system should update search results in real-time as the user types.  
- If no items match the search, the system should display a "No results found" message.  
- The user should be able to clear the search input to return to the full list.  
- The system should handle special characters and spacing gracefully (e.g., "mac & cheese" vs "mac and cheese").

### User Story: Import Recipe from Text

**As a** user  
**I want** to paste or type a recipe into the app as plain text  
**So that** the app can parse the text into structured recipe details and let me verify them before saving to my collection

- The user should be able to freely edit any extracted fields before saving.  
- The system should not save the recipe to the database until the user explicitly confirms.
