- [ ] The system should update search results in real-time as the user types.
- [ ] If no items match the search, the system should display a "No results found" message.
- [ ] The user should be able to clear the search input to return to the full list.
- [ ] The system should handle special characters and spacing gracefully (e.g., "mac & cheese" vs "mac and cheese").

- [ ] The system should validate that the URL is accessible before attempting extraction.
- [ ] If the recipe site is supported, the system should extract structured data (title, ingredients, instructions, nutrition info if available).
- [ ] If the recipe site is unsupported or parsing fails, the system should provide a clear error message.
- [ ] If the user cancels, the extracted recipe should be discarded without saving.

**API**

### User Story: Import Recipe from Text

**As a** user  
**I want** to paste or type a recipe into the app as plain text  
**So that** the app can parse the text into structured recipe details and let me verify them before saving to my collection  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Given I paste or type a recipe into the app  
- [ ] When the system processes the text  
- [ ] Then it extracts recipe details (e.g., title, ingredients, steps, cooking time)  
- [ ] And it displays the structured recipe client-side for my review  
- [ ] And I must confirm or edit the recipe before saving it to my collection  

**Extended Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The system should attempt to parse common recipe formats (e.g., ingredients list, numbered steps).  
- [ ] If parsing succeeds, structured fields (title, ingredients, instructions, etc.) are pre-filled.  
- [ ] If parsing fails or is incomplete, the system should allow me to manually adjust or add missing fields.  
- [ ] The user should be able to freely edit any extracted fields before saving.  
- [ ] The system should not save the recipe to the database until the user explicitly confirms.  
- [ ] If the user cancels, the extracted recipe should be discarded without saving.

## üîß Developer / Maintainer Stories

### User Story: Testing

**As a** developer
**I want** automated unit tests
**So that** I can quickly verify that changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Tests can be run with a single command (e.g. dotnet test).
- [ ] At least one unit test exists for each major feature.
- [ ] Tests run successfully in the CI/CD pipeline.

---

### User Story: Error Handling

**As a** maintainer
**I want** clear error messages and logs
**So that** I can diagnose problems efficiently when they occur.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] All exceptions are logged with a timestamp and stack trace.
- [ ] Logs are stored in a consistent location (e.g. /logs folder).
- [ ] User-facing errors do not expose sensitive information.

---

### User Story: Configuration

**As a** developer
**I want** environment-specific configuration files
**So that** I can run the application locally without affecting production data.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Config files exist for at least two environments (e.g. Development, Production).
- [ ] Switching environments does not require code changes.
- [ ] Local development uses a separate database or data store from production.

---

### User Story: Code Quality

**As a** maintainer
**I want** consistent coding style and linting rules
**So that** the project stays readable over time.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] A linter or style checker is integrated into the project.
- [ ] Code fails CI if it violates defined style rules.
- [ ] Naming conventions and formatting are consistent across files.

---

### User Story: Monitoring / Stability

**As a** maintainer
**I want** to track performance metrics
**So that** I can ensure the system runs reliably under load.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Key performance metrics (e.g. response time, error rate) are captured.
- [ ] Metrics can be viewed in a dashboard or report.
- [ ] System behavior under load has been tested and documented.

---

### User Story: Documentation

**As a** future developer
**I want** setup instructions documented
**so that** I can get the project running quickly without guesswork.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] README includes setup steps (dependencies, build, run instructions).
- [ ] Any required environment variables are documented.
- [ ] A new developer can clone the repo and run the project successfully by following the docs.
