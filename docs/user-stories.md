### User Story: Import Recipe from URL

**As a** user

|------|---------|----------|
| The system should validate that the URL is accessible before attempting extraction | ✅ | ⬜ |
| The system should extract structured data (title, ingredients, instructions) | ✅ | ⬜ |
| If the recipe site is unsupported or parsing fails, the system should provide a clear error message | ✅ | ⬜ |
| If the user cancels, the extracted recipe should be discarded without saving | ✅ | ⬜ |

**API**

### User Story: Import Recipe from Text

**As a** user  
**I want** to paste or type a recipe into the app as plain text  
**So that** the app can parse the text into structured recipe details and let me verify them before saving to my collection  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| Given I paste or type a recipe into the app | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| When the system processes the text | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Then it extracts recipe details (e.g., title, ingredients, steps, cooking time) | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| And it displays the structured recipe client-side for my review | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| And I must confirm or edit the recipe before saving it to my collection | ⬜ | ⬜ |

**Extended Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| The system should attempt to parse common recipe formats (e.g., ingredients list, numbered steps) | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| If parsing succeeds, structured fields (title, ingredients, instructions, etc.) are pre-filled | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| If parsing fails or is incomplete, the system should allow me to manually adjust or add missing fields | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| The user should be able to freely edit any extracted fields before saving | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| The system should not save the recipe to the database until the user explicitly confirms | ⬜ | ⬜ |
