## User Story: Ingredient Selection for Pantry Items

**As a** user,  
**I want** to select or add ingredients when creating a pantry item,  
**so that** I can easily track the foods I have without worrying about duplicates or database structure.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. When creating a new pantry item, the user can start typing the name of an ingredient.
2. The system should search the database for matching ingredients and suggest them in real-time (autocomplete).
3. If the ingredient exists:
   - Selecting it will populate the pantry item with the corresponding `IngredientId`.
4. If the ingredient does not exist:
   - The user can enter the new ingredient name.
   - The system will create the new ingredient in the database before creating the pantry item.
5. From the user‚Äôs perspective, they do not need to distinguish between ingredients and pantry items; they only interact with ingredient names.
6. On the backend, all ingredients are stored in a single table for searchability and consistency.

### Notes

- Ingredient fields: `Id`, `Name`, `Category`
- PantryItem fields: `Id`, `IngredientId`, `Quantity`, `Unit`
- The backend should expose a search endpoint: `GET /ingredients?search=<text>`
- Pantry item creation should accept either an `IngredientId` or an `IngredientName`
