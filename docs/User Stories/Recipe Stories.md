## Story: Import Recipe from Text

***As a*** user  
***I want*** to paste or type a recipe into the app as plain text  
***So that*** the app can parse the text into structured recipe details and let me verify them before saving to my collection  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| Given I paste or type a recipe into the app | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| When the system processes the text | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| Then it extracts recipe details (e.g., title, ingredients, steps, cooking time) | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| And it displays the structured recipe client-side for my review | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| And I must confirm or edit the recipe before saving it to my collection | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |

**Extended Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| The system should attempt to parse common recipe formats (e.g., ingredients list, numbered steps) | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| If parsing succeeds, structured fields (title, ingredients, instructions, etc.) are pre-filled | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| If parsing fails or is incomplete, the system should allow me to manually adjust or add missing fields | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| The user should be able to freely edit any extracted fields before saving | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| The system should not save the recipe to the database until the user explicitly confirms | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
| If the user cancels, the extracted recipe should be discarded without saving | ‚¨ú | ‚¨ú |
