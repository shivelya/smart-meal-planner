## Story: Customize Meal Plan

***As a*** user,
***I want*** to be able to write blobs of text instead of add recipes
***so that*** I can remind myself what I'm making without needing a whole recipe.
- Maybe I'm just making spaghetti and I know I have the ingredients on hand, so I just need to write "spaghetti" as a remidner of what I'm doing Tuesday night.
- Maybe I just need to write in a reminder about a dinner out with friends, or that I'll be too busy to cook that night and need a reminder to pick something up.

**Acceptance Criteria**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| User can add recipes to certain days, or just add notes to certain days | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| User can later edit that text, or delete it and add a recipe | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| User can also have both text and a recipe | â¬œ | â¬œ |
