## Story: Reuse list of foods

**As a** user,
**I want** to select or add ingredients when creating a pantry item,
**so that** I can easily track the foods I have without worrying about duplicates or database structure.

**Acceptance Criteria**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|

|  When creating a new pantry item, the user can start typing the name of an ingredient, and system should search the database for matching ingredients and suggest them in real-time (autocomplete) | âœ… | â¬œ |
|  If the ingredient exists, selecting it will populate the pantry item with the corresponding `IngredientId` | âœ… | â¬œ |
|  If the ingredient does not exist:
   - The user can enter the new ingredient name and category | âœ… | â¬œ |
   - The system will create the new ingredient in the database before creating the pantry item | âœ… | â¬œ |
|  From the userâ€™s perspective, they do not need to distinguish between ingredients and pantry items; they only interact with ingredient names | âœ… | â¬œ |
|  On the backend, all ingredients are stored in a single table for searchability and consistency | âœ… | â¬œ |

**API**
- `GET /api/food?query={search}&skip={skip}&take={take}`

**Response (200)**
```json
{
  "totalCount": 0,
  "items": [

## Story: Pantry Item from Packaged Food (e.g., Box of Crackers)

**As a** user
**I want** to take a picture of a packaged food item, such as a box of crackers
**So that** the system can read the packaging, identify it as "crackers," and automatically create a pantry item entry for me

**Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| Given I take a photo of a packaged food item | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| When the system processes the image | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| Then it recognizes the product type (e.g., crackers) | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| And it generates a pantry item with the appropriate name and details | â¬œ | â¬œ |

**Extended Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| The system should attempt to extract additional details from the packaging (e.g., brand, weight, flavor) | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| The system should auto-populate the pantry item | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| The system should prompt the user to confirm or correct the item | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| The pantry item should include default quantity (e.g., 1 box) unless more detail is detected | â¬œ | â¬œ |

## Story: Pantry Item from Fresh Food (e.g., Banana)

**As a** user
**I want** to take a picture of a fresh food item, such as a banana

**Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| The user can upload a photo for detection | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| The system should attempt to detect the type of food in the image | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| The system should auto-populate the pantry item | â¬œ | â¬œ |
| The system should prompt the user to confirm or correct the item | â¬œ | â¬œ |

## Story: Search Pantry Items by Name

**As a** user
**I want** to search for pantry items by entering their name
**So that** I can quickly find a specific item in my pantry list without scrolling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
| Task | Backend | Frontend |
|------|---------|----------|
| Given I am on the pantry screen, I can type a name (full of partial) into a search bar. | âœ… | â¬œ |
| The the pantry list updates to show only matching items. | âœ… | â¬œ |
| And the search is case-insensitive (e.g., "Crackers" matches "crackers"). | âœ… | â¬œ |
| The system should support partial matches (e.g., typing "crack" returns "crackers") | âœ… | â¬œ |
| The system should update search results in real-time as the user types |  | â¬œ |
| If no items match the search, the system should display a "No results found" message |  | â¬œ |
| The user should be able to clear the search input to return to the full list |  | â¬œ |
| The system should handle special characters and spacing gracefully (e.g., "mac & cheese" vs "mac and cheese") | â¬œ | â¬œ |

**API**
